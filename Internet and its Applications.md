## The Networking and Internet Basics

## Types of network

**Local Area Network (LAN)**  
a network of computers and other devices over a geographical area **smaller** than WAN - a single or a group of buildings 

types of LAN:  

* Wired LAN
* Wireless LAN (WLAN)

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**  
composed of LANs connected through routers over a **larger** geographical area - a country or the world (**The Internet**)

### Types of Connections

* **peer-to-peer network** - computers are connected to nearby computers
  + examples
    - BitTorrent
    - P2PTV
    - PDTP
  + advantages
    - resources can be accessed by other users
    - encouraging community resource sharing and cooperation
  + disadvantages
    - Intellectual property law and illegal sharing
    - Network neutrality - extra bandwith-usage
* **client-server connection** - all computers are connected to a server
  + examples
    - dedicated server games
    - majority of the websites on the Internet
  + advantages
    - users can be given different levels of access to the data in the server
  + disadvantages
    - require connection to the dedicated server

## Hardware

**Network Interface Card (NIC)**  
provide interface for communication over network
has unique **Media Access Control (MAC)** address for identification

**Connection Devices**

* Hubs
  + can act as a repeater
  + multiple ports - connects computers
  + message received from one port is forwarded to all ports
  + cannot simultaneously transmit messages (collision will occur)
* Switches
  + multiple ports - connects computers
  + message received from one port is forward to destination port
  + can simultaneously transmit messages (less collision)
  + perform the forwarding according to MAC address of NIC of the destination
  + switch-based generally faster than hub-based network
* Repeater
  + amplify signals
  + remove noise
* Bridges
  + connect LANs of same type
* Routers
  + connect LANs of different type to form WAN
  + connect LANs and Internet
  + perform routing, i.e. find best path for packets to destination, and store routing table
  + perform forwarding according to IP address of the destination
* Access point
  + multiple devices connected to form a wireless network
  + may act as a router

**Modem**

* perform modulation - convert digital signals into analogue signals
* perform demodulation - convert analogue signals into digital signals
* examples
  + dial-up modem
  + cabble modem (cable TV)
  + Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modem

**Wires**

* telephone lines
* **coaxial cables**
  + electric signals
* **twisted-pair wires**
  + electric signals
  + twisted to reduce EM interference
  + 2 types
    - shielded twisted pair (**STP**) cables
    - unshielded twisted pair (**UTP**) cables
  + commonly used in LANs
* **optical fibres**
  + light signals
  + faster
  + difficult to eavesdrop
  + more expensive
  + require signal conversion device

| </empty>     | twisted pair cables | coaxial cables | optical fibres |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| interference | relatively high     | medium         | low            |
| distance     | short               | medium         | very long      |

  + sender convert digital signal to radio signal
  + receiver convert radio signal to digital signal
  + require wireless NIC

## Network Switching (extra)

the process of **forwarding messages or informations** in networking

Categories:

* Connectionless - no previous communication is established
* Connection Oriented - pre-established communication is established

Types of switching:

* **Circuit Switching**
  + communicate over a **dedicated** communciation path 
  + **remains connected** during the communication session
* **Message Switching**
  + data is routed in its entirety
  + data is stored in the intermediate nodes
  + **store-and-forward** technique
* **Packet Switching**
  + entire data is broken down into smaller chunks called **packets**
  + info is added to the **header**
  + packages are stored and forwarded

## Multiplexing (extra)

method to **combine multiple signals** into one signal **over shared medium**  
e.g. multiple telephone calls carried out using one wire  

Types:

* Space-division multiplexing (**SDM**)
  + use of **separate point-to-point electrical conductors** for each channel
  + faster than TDM
  + require physical connection per communication pair
* Frequency-division multiplexing (**FDM**)
  + use of several distinct **frequencies** for each channel
  + used in analogue system
  + channel allocated any time
* Time-division multiplexing (**TDM**)
  + use at different **time** for each channel
  + require precise clock synchronization
* Code-division multiplexing (**CDM**)

## Internet Access

**Internet Service Providers (ISP)** provide access to the Internet  

ways to connect:  

* dial-up access
  + requires dial-up modem & telephone line to connect to Internt via ISP
* Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)

* leased line
  + dedicated line that provide digital comminication services
  + example:  
    - T-carriers
* broadband connection
  + by any means (optical fibre, coaxial, twisted-pair) faster than dial-up access
  + example:
    - asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)
    - symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL)
    - cable modem 
* wireless Internet access
  + by not using any wired connection, generally by microwave or radiowave connections

    - Wi-Fi hot spots
    - mobile broadband
    - wireless application protocol (WAP)
    - general packet radio services (GPRS)
    - high speed packet access (HSPA) and HSPA+

**protocols** are a set of rules guiding communcation between computer systems through standardization

open system interconnection (OSI) mode:

1. Physical layer
2. Data link layer (Frame)
3. Network layer (Packet)
  + IP
4. Transport layer (Datagram)
  + TCP, UDP
5. Session layer
6. Presentation layer
7. Application layer (Data)
  + FTP, HTTP

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**  
responsible for:

* division of messages into packets
* transmission
* verificaiton
* reassembling of packets

**Internet Protocol (IP)**  
responsible for:  

* divide packets into fragments (smaller pieces) according to the transmission rate
* routing the packets to destination

**IP Addess**

* for identifying the device with the network interface
* all devices using IP will have an IP address
* IP identify destinations according to IP address
* IP address have 2 parts
  + network part - identify the network on the Internet
  + host part - identify particular device in the network

**IPv4 Address**

* consists of 4 numbers, each 8 bits (2 hex digits), total 32 bits (8 hex digits)
* each numbers value range from 0 - 255 (0 - FF)
* example: 133.23.234.66
* classes for networks of different sizes

**IPv6 Address**  

* consists of 8 hex numbers, each 16 bits (4 hex digits), total 128 bits (32 hex digits)
* each number value range from 0000 - FFFF
* example: 5EAA:0162:1687: B244:0016:022C:0001:09BD

**Domain Name**
is a representation of IP address

* easier for human to read and memorize
* each parts separated by a period ('.')
* example: www.google.com.hk
* generic top-level domain (gTLD)
  + commercial - .com
  + general organization - .org
  + educational - .edu
  + governmental - .gov
  + network - .net
  + individual - .idv
* country-code top-level domain (ccTLD)
  + china - .cn
  + japan - .jp
  + hong kong - .hk
  + united kingdom - .uk
  + canada - .ca
  + united states - .us
  + australia - .au

**Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**  
a particular location of resource on the Web  
e.g. http://www.originalpress.com/main/main_page.html

* http - protocol
* www - host name
* .originalpress - second level domain
* .com - TLD
* /main - folder name
* /main_page.html - file name

**Domain Name System (DNS)**  
translates domain names into relevant IP addresses and vice versa, the process is called **name resolution**  

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**  

* transfer hypertext file to World Wide Web  
* run on top of TCP/IP  
* file is stored in web server  
* displayed on web browser upon request by a client

## Terms for Answering Questions
